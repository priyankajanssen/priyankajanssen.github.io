I am a result driven IT professional skilled in leading, analysis, planning, design and delivery of complex projects and transition programs. I am highly adept at managing multiple items simultaneously taking complete ownership while maintaining composure, discipline and a sense of humor. I have a strong background in Robotic Process Automation and machine learning (NLP) as part of my master thesis during by MBA along with over ten years work experience in managed services environment. I have led large scale transformation programs and offshoring projects involving multiple disciplines and partners.

Personal values I hold very dear are honesty, integrity and trust. I believe in itâ€™s important to say what you really think and provide an open communication environment therefore I am able to build strong teams and meaningful relationships.

On a side note, I'm absurdly good at eating spicy food. Unfortunately, there's not much of a market for that skill...
