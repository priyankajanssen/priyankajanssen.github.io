</div>

Experienced IT Professional with over 13 years of experience in leading, designing and delivering complex projects and transition programs. Because of my broad experience across many aspects I have led large scale transformation programmes and offshoring projects involving multiple disciplines and partners. My engineering background enables me to quickly grasp new concepts, tools and technologies. 

Personal values I hold very dear are honesty, integrity and trust. I believe in it’s important to say what you really think and provide an open communication environment therefore I am able to build strong teams and meaningful relationships.

On a side note, I'm absurdly good at eating spicy food. Unfortunately,
there's not much of a market for that skill...​
