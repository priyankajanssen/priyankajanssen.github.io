I am a result driven IT professional skilled in leading, analysis,
planning, design and delivery of complex projects and transition
programs. I am highly adept at managing multiple items simultaneously
taking complete ownership while maintaining composure, discipline and a
sense of humor. I have a strong background in Robotic Process Automation
and machine learning (NLP) as part of my master thesis during by MBA
along with over ten years work experience in managed services
environment. I have led large scale transformation programs and
offshoring projects involving multiple disciplines and partners.

Personal values I hold very dear are honesty, integrity and trust. I
believe in it's important to say what you really think and provide an
open communication environment therefore I am able to build strong teams
and meaningful relationships.

On a side note, I'm absurdly good at eating spicy food. Unfortunately,
there's not much of a market for that skill...​
